- Examine Preparation Courses Impact: Determine whether completion of preparation courses significantly influences student performance across the three subjects.
- Analyze Interactions: Explore potential interactions between socio-demographic factors and their combined effect on student performance.
- Provide Insights for Educational Interventions: Generate actionable insights that can inform educational interventions aimed at improving student outcomes and promoting equity in education.
