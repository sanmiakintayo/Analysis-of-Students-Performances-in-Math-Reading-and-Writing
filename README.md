# Insight-and-Trends-in-Real-Estate-Sales

### Project Overview
This project analyzes real estate sales data from 2001 to 2021. The goal is to uncover trends, patterns, and insights that can inform future real estate investments and market strategies.

### Objectives
•	Identify Market Trends: Examine how property prices have evolved over the years and the impact of economic events on these trends.
•	Assess Property Value Fluctuations: Compare assessed values with sale amounts to evaluate the accuracy of property assessments.
•	Segment Analysis by Property Type: Analyze sales trends across different property types (e.g., residential, commercial) to identify growth areas.
•	Geographical Analysis: Investigate real estate trends across various towns to pinpoint high-growth areas.
•	Seasonal Patterns: Determine if there are seasonal trends in real estate sales to identify optimal buying and selling periods.
•	Impact of Residential Type: Analyze sales data based on residential types (e.g., single-family homes, apartments) to understand market preferences.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
